# Get complete Age (date, month, year)

This package provides you with hassle free calculation of your current dob.
The idea came when I coundn't find any package which gave me complete details of my dob.

# Usage

```sh
$ npm get-complete-age
$ import {getAge} from "get-complete-age"
$ getAge(yourDob)
```

# Respnose

```sh
$ npm get-complete-age
$ import {getAge} from "get-complete-age"
$ getAge(yourDob)
```
