# Get complete Age (date, month, year)

This package provides you with hassle free calculation of your current dob.
The idea came when I coundn't find any package which gave me complete details of my dob.

# Usage

```sh
 npm get-complete-age
 import {getAge} from "get-complete-age"
 getAge(yourDob)
```

# Response

Response would be an object

```sh
{
    "years"  :"years passed in int",
    "months" :"months passed in int",
    "days"   :"days passed in int",
}
```

# Upcoming Features!
